When making a mock paypal purchase, you need to use a fictional
email and a fictional password, which are found at developer.paypal.com,
where you sign into the Dashboard then go to Sandbox -> Accounts
-> there are 2 business and 2 personal accounts.  The business
accounts are sellers, the personal accounts are buyers, so use
one of the personal accounts to make a mock purchase.
